## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project idea is to create a website where you can find and review dog parks.  Users will be able to read/leave ratings and reviews on dog parks.  Users will be able to see basic information on the dog parks such as capacity, free or paid, and location.  Users will be able to search for dog parks based on location as well as if the park is free or a membership is required.### Features
Include Features here

Finding good dog parks can be hard especially when most of the best parks are membership based with limited memberships available.  This website will try to make it easier for you and your four-legged friend to find a great dog-friendly park.
